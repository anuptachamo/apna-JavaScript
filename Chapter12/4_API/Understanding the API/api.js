 *  ? What is API?
 *      => Many people ask themselves, “What is an API?” API is the acronym for application programming interface — a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organizations.

APIs are all around us. Every time you use a rideshare app, send a mobile payment, or change the thermostat temperature from your phone, you’re using an API.

* ? Understanding API(Application Programming Interface)
        => API is like a waiter, first waiter take order from Me and waiter go to the Kitchen and place a order from the Kitchen to us.Now simply understand that ME is USER, WAITER is API and KITCHEN is a SERVER in which USER request API for data and API go  to the SERVER and SERVER give a data to API and API reponse to the USER.
