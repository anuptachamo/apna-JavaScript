/**
 *  ?Identifier Rules
 *      All javascript variables must be identified with unique names(identifiers).
 *          - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. (no space)
 *          - Names must begin with a letter.
 *          - Names can also begin with $ and _.
 *          - Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
 *          - reserved words (like javaScript keywords) CANNOT be used as names.
 *  
 *  ? CamelCase
 *      way of writing identifiers
 *          camelCase (JS naming convention) --for example: let fullName;
 *          snake_case                       --for example: let full_name;
 *          PascalCase                       --for example: let FullName;
 *  
 *              !MOSTLY USE camelCase in javaScript
